Installation
============


Single Machine Simulation
---------------------------

To use ``Blades`` on a single machine, you only need to install the simulator using ``pip``:

>>> pip install blades

Ray Cluster Simulation
---------------------------

Borrowing the power of `Ray <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html#>`_, ``Blades`` can be easily adapted to clusters without
changing a single line of the code.

.. seealso::
   See how to deploy ``Ray cluster`` according to the `official guide <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/user-guide.html>`_.
   Make sure that both ``Python`` and ``Ray`` on all machines has the same version.
